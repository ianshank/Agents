## [Unreleased] — Quality & Eval-Integrity Gates

### Added
- **Regression Gate (F-006):** `scripts/regression_gate.py` — materialises an isolated
  HEAD baseline via `git worktree` and blocks only *net-new* ruff/offline-test failures,
  complementing the absolute coverage gate. Line-keyed lint identity, robust class-based
  junit nodeid reconstruction, configurable lint/test paths + base ref + `block`/`warn`
  mode, and a JSON report validated by `scripts/regression_report.schema.json`.
- **Eval-Integrity Protected-Path Guard (F-007):** `scripts/eval_protected_paths.py`
  (single source of truth + glob matcher) and `scripts/check_protected_changes.py` CI
  guard, backed by `.github/CODEOWNERS`, require human approval (the `eval-change-approved`
  label) for any change to evaluation-defining files (features, config, gating, scorers,
  judges, validations, tests, CI).
- **Auto-Fix Loop — design-only, disabled (F-008):** `scripts/fix_loop.py` inert skeleton
  with a path-traversal-safe `ScopeGuard` that cannot write to protected paths, plus
  `docs/decisions/0004-auto-fix-loop.md` and the human enable-checklist.
- **Quality-Gates Workflow:** `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` runs feature
  validation, a dedicated ≥85% coverage gate for the new tooling, the regression gate
  (vs the PR base), and the protected-path guard.

### Changed
- **`.gitignore` / `.dockerignore`:** Ignore `regression_report.json` and
  `.regression_gate_junit.xml`.
- **`tests/conftest.py`:** Expose `scripts/` on `sys.path` so tooling has first-class tests.
- **README / C4 Architecture:** Document the quality-gate and eval-integrity layer.

### Security
- Hardened `ScopeGuard` against path-traversal / absolute-path escapes (per peer review):
  writes are confined to the project root *and* outside the protected set.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Skill Framework (F-003, F-004):** `scripts/validate_skill.py` tiered validation engine
  with structural + behavioral checks and `evals.json`-driven assertions.
- **OpenAI Judge Skill (F-004):** Full `skills/openai-judge/` skill with SKILL.md, eval
  fixtures, and a CLI runner supporting NVIDIA Nemotron & LM Studio backends.
- **Langfuse Tracing (F-005):** End-to-end Langfuse integration — `SDKLangfuseClient`,
  `observe()` decorator, `SafeLangfuseContext`, trace-to-dataset-item linking, and
  auto-wrapping of OpenAI client via `langfuse.openai`.
- **Spec-driven Development (F-001):** `validate.py`, `select_next.py`, `features.yaml`,
  `features.schema.json`, and per-feature validation scripts.
- **ADR Documents:** `0001-openai-compatible-judge.md`, `0002-skill-framework.md`,
  `0003-langfuse-integration.md`.
- **Snyk Integration:** Project registered for continuous dependency monitoring. `.snyk`
  policy file and `requirements.txt` manifest added.
- **`.dockerignore`:** Keeps container images lean.
- **C4 Architecture Diagram:** `docs/c4_architecture.md` — Mermaid-based context, container,
  and component views.

### Changed
- **`.gitignore`:** Expanded to cover `.coverage.*` shards, `.env` files, IDE artifacts,
  OS files, Snyk policy, and benchmark/output directories.
- **`README.md`:** Updated to reflect Langfuse, Snyk, OpenAI judge, and skill framework.
  Added architecture section, environment variable reference, and CI integration guide.
- **`pyproject.toml`:** Added `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.mypy]` configuration sections.
  Added `ruff`, `mypy` to dev dependencies.

### Fixed
- **Security (CRITICAL):** Removed hardcoded Langfuse API keys from
  `langfuse_client/__init__.py`. Credentials are now sourced exclusively from
  environment variables or explicit kwargs.
- **Security:** Removed `pragma: no cover` from `SDKLangfuseClient` — the class is
  exercised by mocked tests and should contribute to coverage.
- **Testing:** Replaced `os.environ.clear()` in `test_langfuse_integration.py` with
  `monkeypatch` — fixes 24 cascading test failures on Windows due to destroyed
  `ComSpec` / `SystemRoot` variables.
- **Testing:** Rewrote `test_langfuse_integration.py` from `unittest.TestCase` to
  idiomatic `pytest` style with `monkeypatch` for environment isolation.
- **Config Loader:** Added `encoding="utf-8"` to `config/__init__.py` `load_config()`
  to fix silent encoding errors on Windows (`cp1252` default).
- **Logging:** Replaced f-string logger calls with lazy `%s` formatting in `judges/`
  and `langfuse_client/` to avoid unnecessary string interpolation.

### Security
- **Snyk Scan:** 9 dependency vulnerabilities identified (4 High in `urllib3`, 5 Medium).
  Documented in `CHANGELOG.md` and `requirements.txt` with minimum safe versions.
